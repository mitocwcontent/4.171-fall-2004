description: This handout contains an article authored by the course instructor in
  1993. It describes the rationale behind the workshop, and the reasons for considering
  space to be as valuable as buildings. It cites references in Siena, Italy, Oak Bluffs
  on Martha's Vineyard, and San Juan in Puerto Rico, and describes how, in each of
  these instances, beautiful and inspirational public spaces were purposefully created
  and how the spaces in these cities are more than just leftover.
